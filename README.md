# UnitySolids
A demonstration of procedurally generated tile meshes using Unity3D
Using Unity3D 2017.2.0

This application demonstrates several aspects of procedural generation, including:
- Generating a mesh entirely using code
- Generating a repeating grid of square or hexagonal "cells"
- Properly texturing both of the aforementioned meshes
- Simple animation of a hex grid to show a single mesh acting as multiple seemingly individual tiles
